# General Assembly Homework 5 - Slack NavBar

  

Homework assignment #5 for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was to 
-   Use responsive design strategies to recreate the Slack site’s navigation.
-   Use the **position** property to implement dynamic menus.
-   Learn about transitions and dropdown menu UI patterns.

-   The menus for each item in the main nav are called **dropdowns**, or sometimes tooltips. They pop up when you hover over the menu item. Explore how this works.

Think about the elements with which you’re interacting. When does the menu show up? Why? When does it go away? Which specific elements are involved? How do you target them?
